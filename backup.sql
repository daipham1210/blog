21	Everything You Need to Know About Milk Substitutes	Oat milk. Almond milk. Cashew milk. Soy milk. There are so many milk alternatives out there today… and it can be tough to figure out what types might be best for you. Enter our favorite healthy eating expert Dr. Mark Hyman, author of Food: What the Heck Should I Cook?. He’s here to help us understand why these milk alternatives have become so popular in recent years — and which types might be the most beneficial.\r\n\r\n**Katie Couric: It used to be that, at a coffee shop, you had a choice between milk or cream. Now? It’s all that — and so much more. Before we go into the various types of milk substitutes and their benefits (or lack thereof), can you tell us a bit about the rise in alternatives to milk? What spurred this trend?**\r\n\r\nDr. Mark Hyman: Milk alternatives are everywhere. An important reason behind this trend is the growing awareness that many people don’t digest dairy well. Sixty to 70 percent of the world’s population is lactose intolerant. This is a deficiency of the enzyme required to break down the sugar (lactose) in cow’s milk. Consumers are more conscious about the way food impacts how they feel.\r\n\r\nIn my practice, dairy affects my patients in many ways related to inflammation: gastrointestinal issues such as irritable bowel or reflux, asthma and sinus problems, eczema and acne. People understand that dairy alternatives can provide the culinary benefits without the risks. There is also increasing concern about factory farming of animals, and its impact on animal welfare, the overuse of antibiotics and hormones, climate change and environmental degradation. These are among the main reasons we see a rise in milk alternatives.\r\n\r\n**Now, can you tell us about the different types of milk substitutes?**\r\n\r\nSoy milk was the first dairy alternative, but competitors have flourished in the wake of concerns about soy, glyphosate (the herbicide used on soybeans and its potential estrogenic effects. Today almond, coconut, cashew, hazelnut, hemp, macadamia and oat milk are found in most stores. In the past decade we’ve seen a renaissance non-dairy milks. Large food companies are buying up the small milk alternative companies following the trend away from traditional dairy.\r\n\r\n**Are milk substitutes actually healthy? Are they any better or worse for us than regular milk? What should we watch out for with these dairy alternatives?**\r\n\r\nJust because it’s natural or from beans or nuts doesn’t mean it’s healthy. Most versions of non-dairy milks are loaded with sugar, gums and thickeners. Even the organic, unsweetened versions contain additives designed to make nut and rice water look and taste like cow’s milk.\r\n\r\nOne of these additives is carrageenan, a thickening agent that’s used in ice cream, yogurt, cottage cheese, and other dairy products. It’s derived from seaweed, but it’s no innocent sea vegetable. It’s an irritant that causes cancer in lab rats. In humans, carrageenan has been associated with ulcers, leaky gut, inflammation and even autoimmune disease. It has no nutritional value, and yet the FDA approves its use in baby formula. It should be avoided completely. Other thickeners may not be as problematic but are still cause for concerns such as the gums — xanthan gum, guar gum, locust bean gum — and anything else that sounds like it was made in a lab.\r\n\r\nYou’re not losing much by skipping these mass-produced drinks. In fact, many milk alternatives are so bereft of nutrients that they have to be supplemented with added vitamins and minerals to appear even slightly beneficial. Only soy milk has a meaningful amount of protein. But soy milk comes with its own problems, like a hefty amount of phytoestrogens, which may mimic estrogen in the body when consumed in excess. Even worse, many varieties of soy milk are made soy protein isolates linked to cancer rather than whole beans. A little soy may be fine, but choose organic, non-GMO to avoid glyphosate which has been linked to cancer.\r\n\r\n**When it comes to choosing between the different milk substitutes, what type would you recommend we try out?**\r\n\r\nI usually recommend making your own milk substitutes. It’s easy — just soak a bag of almonds, hazelnuts, or cashews in a bowl overnight to soften them up, and then blend them with water and a little vanilla extract. Soaking them also unlocks their nutrients, which makes them easier for your body to absorb. But make small batches; the milk doesn’t keep for long (more than a week in the fridge). You can also make your own coconut milk.\r\n\r\nIf this isn’t possible, there are a few brands of non-dairy milks that are pretty clean. You just have to look at the ingredients. Stick with hemp, almond, macadamia or cashew milks but always choose unsweetened and make sure they have no carageenan.\r\n\r\n**Finally, what is your preferred milk alternative, and why?**\r\n\r\nOne of my personal favorites is macadamia milk. It’s really creamy and tasty. Macadamia nuts contain beneficial monounsaturated fats that support metabolic and cardiovascular health and nutrients that support brain health, so overall they make a very nutrient-dense milk substitute.\r\n	2019-12-20 04:49:48.082824	2019-12-20 04:49:48.082824	everything-you-need-to-know-about-milk-substitutes-5aab7ea8-570e-48d3-a0b5-5d718e11b931	1	1	\N

23	Everything You Need to Know About Milk Substitutes	Oat milk. Almond milk. Cashew milk. Soy milk. There are so many milk alternatives out there today… and it can be tough to figure out what types might be best for you. Enter our favorite healthy eating expert Dr. Mark Hyman, author of Food: What the Heck Should I Cook?. He’s here to help us understand why these milk alternatives have become so popular in recent years — and which types might be the most beneficial.\r\n\r\n**Katie Couric: It used to be that, at a coffee shop, you had a choice between milk or cream. Now? It’s all that — and so much more. Before we go into the various types of milk substitutes and their benefits (or lack thereof), can you tell us a bit about the rise in alternatives to milk? What spurred this trend?**\r\n\r\nDr. Mark Hyman: Milk alternatives are everywhere. An important reason behind this trend is the growing awareness that many people don’t digest dairy well. Sixty to 70 percent of the world’s population is lactose intolerant. This is a deficiency of the enzyme required to break down the sugar (lactose) in cow’s milk. Consumers are more conscious about the way food impacts how they feel.\r\n\r\nIn my practice, dairy affects my patients in many ways related to inflammation: gastrointestinal issues such as irritable bowel or reflux, asthma and sinus problems, eczema and acne. People understand that dairy alternatives can provide the culinary benefits without the risks. There is also increasing concern about factory farming of animals, and its impact on animal welfare, the overuse of antibiotics and hormones, climate change and environmental degradation. These are among the main reasons we see a rise in milk alternatives.\r\n\r\n**Now, can you tell us about the different types of milk substitutes?**\r\n\r\nSoy milk was the first dairy alternative, but competitors have flourished in the wake of concerns about soy, glyphosate (the herbicide used on soybeans and its potential estrogenic effects. Today almond, coconut, cashew, hazelnut, hemp, macadamia and oat milk are found in most stores. In the past decade we’ve seen a renaissance non-dairy milks. Large food companies are buying up the small milk alternative companies following the trend away from traditional dairy.\r\n\r\n**Are milk substitutes actually healthy? Are they any better or worse for us than regular milk? What should we watch out for with these dairy alternatives?**\r\n\r\nJust because it’s natural or from beans or nuts doesn’t mean it’s healthy. Most versions of non-dairy milks are loaded with sugar, gums and thickeners. Even the organic, unsweetened versions contain additives designed to make nut and rice water look and taste like cow’s milk.\r\n\r\nOne of these additives is carrageenan, a thickening agent that’s used in ice cream, yogurt, cottage cheese, and other dairy products. It’s derived from seaweed, but it’s no innocent sea vegetable. It’s an irritant that causes cancer in lab rats. In humans, carrageenan has been associated with ulcers, leaky gut, inflammation and even autoimmune disease. It has no nutritional value, and yet the FDA approves its use in baby formula. It should be avoided completely. Other thickeners may not be as problematic but are still cause for concerns such as the gums — xanthan gum, guar gum, locust bean gum — and anything else that sounds like it was made in a lab.\r\n\r\nYou’re not losing much by skipping these mass-produced drinks. In fact, many milk alternatives are so bereft of nutrients that they have to be supplemented with added vitamins and minerals to appear even slightly beneficial. Only soy milk has a meaningful amount of protein. But soy milk comes with its own problems, like a hefty amount of phytoestrogens, which may mimic estrogen in the body when consumed in excess. Even worse, many varieties of soy milk are made soy protein isolates linked to cancer rather than whole beans. A little soy may be fine, but choose organic, non-GMO to avoid glyphosate which has been linked to cancer.\r\n\r\n**When it comes to choosing between the different milk substitutes, what type would you recommend we try out?**\r\n\r\nI usually recommend making your own milk substitutes. It’s easy — just soak a bag of almonds, hazelnuts, or cashews in a bowl overnight to soften them up, and then blend them with water and a little vanilla extract. Soaking them also unlocks their nutrients, which makes them easier for your body to absorb. But make small batches; the milk doesn’t keep for long (more than a week in the fridge). You can also make your own coconut milk.\r\n\r\nIf this isn’t possible, there are a few brands of non-dairy milks that are pretty clean. You just have to look at the ingredients. Stick with hemp, almond, macadamia or cashew milks but always choose unsweetened and make sure they have no carageenan.\r\n\r\n**Finally, what is your preferred milk alternative, and why?**\r\n\r\nOne of my personal favorites is macadamia milk. It’s really creamy and tasty. Macadamia nuts contain beneficial monounsaturated fats that support metabolic and cardiovascular health and nutrients that support brain health, so overall they make a very nutrient-dense milk substitute.\r\n	2019-12-20 04:49:48.097242	2019-12-20 04:49:48.097242	everything-you-need-to-know-about-milk-substitutes-824e5c54-a4fe-4077-81cd-3c222fbe5e54	1	1	\N

7	Everything You Need to Know About Milk Substitutes	Oat milk. Almond milk. Cashew milk. Soy milk. There are so many milk alternatives out there today… and it can be tough to figure out what types might be best for you. Enter our favorite healthy eating expert Dr. Mark Hyman, author of Food: What the Heck Should I Cook?. He’s here to help us understand why these milk alternatives have become so popular in recent years — and which types might be the most beneficial.\r\n\r\n**Katie Couric: It used to be that, at a coffee shop, you had a choice between milk or cream. Now? It’s all that — and so much more. Before we go into the various types of milk substitutes and their benefits (or lack thereof), can you tell us a bit about the rise in alternatives to milk? What spurred this trend?**\r\n\r\nDr. Mark Hyman: Milk alternatives are everywhere. An important reason behind this trend is the growing awareness that many people don’t digest dairy well. Sixty to 70 percent of the world’s population is lactose intolerant. This is a deficiency of the enzyme required to break down the sugar (lactose) in cow’s milk. Consumers are more conscious about the way food impacts how they feel.\r\n\r\nIn my practice, dairy affects my patients in many ways related to inflammation: gastrointestinal issues such as irritable bowel or reflux, asthma and sinus problems, eczema and acne. People understand that dairy alternatives can provide the culinary benefits without the risks. There is also increasing concern about factory farming of animals, and its impact on animal welfare, the overuse of antibiotics and hormones, climate change and environmental degradation. These are among the main reasons we see a rise in milk alternatives.\r\n\r\n**Now, can you tell us about the different types of milk substitutes?**\r\n\r\nSoy milk was the first dairy alternative, but competitors have flourished in the wake of concerns about soy, glyphosate (the herbicide used on soybeans and its potential estrogenic effects. Today almond, coconut, cashew, hazelnut, hemp, macadamia and oat milk are found in most stores. In the past decade we’ve seen a renaissance non-dairy milks. Large food companies are buying up the small milk alternative companies following the trend away from traditional dairy.\r\n\r\n**Are milk substitutes actually healthy? Are they any better or worse for us than regular milk? What should we watch out for with these dairy alternatives?**\r\n\r\nJust because it’s natural or from beans or nuts doesn’t mean it’s healthy. Most versions of non-dairy milks are loaded with sugar, gums and thickeners. Even the organic, unsweetened versions contain additives designed to make nut and rice water look and taste like cow’s milk.\r\n\r\nOne of these additives is carrageenan, a thickening agent that’s used in ice cream, yogurt, cottage cheese, and other dairy products. It’s derived from seaweed, but it’s no innocent sea vegetable. It’s an irritant that causes cancer in lab rats. In humans, carrageenan has been associated with ulcers, leaky gut, inflammation and even autoimmune disease. It has no nutritional value, and yet the FDA approves its use in baby formula. It should be avoided completely. Other thickeners may not be as problematic but are still cause for concerns such as the gums — xanthan gum, guar gum, locust bean gum — and anything else that sounds like it was made in a lab.\r\n\r\nYou’re not losing much by skipping these mass-produced drinks. In fact, many milk alternatives are so bereft of nutrients that they have to be supplemented with added vitamins and minerals to appear even slightly beneficial. Only soy milk has a meaningful amount of protein. But soy milk comes with its own problems, like a hefty amount of phytoestrogens, which may mimic estrogen in the body when consumed in excess. Even worse, many varieties of soy milk are made soy protein isolates linked to cancer rather than whole beans. A little soy may be fine, but choose organic, non-GMO to avoid glyphosate which has been linked to cancer.\r\n\r\n**When it comes to choosing between the different milk substitutes, what type would you recommend we try out?**\r\n\r\nI usually recommend making your own milk substitutes. It’s easy — just soak a bag of almonds, hazelnuts, or cashews in a bowl overnight to soften them up, and then blend them with water and a little vanilla extract. Soaking them also unlocks their nutrients, which makes them easier for your body to absorb. But make small batches; the milk doesn’t keep for long (more than a week in the fridge). You can also make your own coconut milk.\r\n\r\nIf this isn’t possible, there are a few brands of non-dairy milks that are pretty clean. You just have to look at the ingredients. Stick with hemp, almond, macadamia or cashew milks but always choose unsweetened and make sure they have no carageenan.\r\n\r\n**Finally, what is your preferred milk alternative, and why?**\r\n\r\nOne of my personal favorites is macadamia milk.

25	Everything You Need to Know About Milk Substitutes	Oat milk. Almond milk. Cashew milk. Soy milk. There are so many milk alternatives out there today… and it can be tough to figure out what types might be best for you. Enter our favorite healthy eating expert Dr. Mark Hyman, author of Food: What the Heck Should I Cook?. He’s here to help us understand why these milk alternatives have become so popular in recent years — and which types might be the most beneficial.\r\n\r\n**Katie Couric: It used to be that, at a coffee shop, you had a choice between milk or cream. Now? It’s all that — and so much more. Before we go into the various types of milk substitutes and their benefits (or lack thereof), can you tell us a bit about the rise in alternatives to milk? What spurred this trend?**\r\n\r\nDr. Mark Hyman: Milk alternatives are everywhere. An important reason behind this trend is the growing awareness that many people don’t digest dairy well. Sixty to 70 percent of the world’s population is lactose intolerant. This is a deficiency of the enzyme required to break down the sugar (lactose) in cow’s milk. Consumers are more conscious about the way food impacts how they feel.\r\n\r\nIn my practice, dairy affects my patients in many ways related to inflammation: gastrointestinal issues such as irritable bowel or reflux, asthma and sinus problems, eczema and acne. People understand that dairy alternatives can provide the culinary benefits without the risks. There is also increasing concern about factory farming of animals, and its impact on animal welfare, the overuse of antibiotics and hormones, climate change and environmental degradation. These are among the main reasons we see a rise in milk alternatives.\r\n\r\n**Now, can you tell us about the different types of milk substitutes?**\r\n\r\nSoy milk was the first dairy alternative, but competitors have flourished in the wake of concerns about soy, glyphosate (the herbicide used on soybeans and its potential estrogenic effects. Today almond, coconut, cashew, hazelnut, hemp, macadamia and oat milk are found in most stores. In the past decade we’ve seen a renaissance non-dairy milks. Large food companies are buying up the small milk alternative companies following the trend away from traditional dairy.\r\n\r\n**Are milk substitutes actually healthy? Are they any better or worse for us than regular milk? What should we watch out for with these dairy alternatives?**\r\n\r\nJust because it’s natural or from beans or nuts doesn’t mean it’s healthy. Most versions of non-dairy milks are loaded with sugar, gums and thickeners. Even the organic, unsweetened versions contain additives designed to make nut and rice water look and taste like cow’s milk.\r\n\r\nOne of these additives is carrageenan, a thickening agent that’s used in ice cream, yogurt, cottage cheese, and other dairy products. It’s derived from seaweed, but it’s no innocent sea vegetable. It’s an irritant that causes cancer in lab rats. In humans, carrageenan has been associated with ulcers, leaky gut, inflammation and even autoimmune disease. It has no nutritional value, and yet the FDA approves its use in baby formula. It should be avoided completely. Other thickeners may not be as problematic but are still cause for concerns such as the gums — xanthan gum, guar gum, locust bean gum — and anything else that sounds like it was made in a lab.\r\n\r\nYou’re not losing much by skipping these mass-produced drinks. In fact, many milk alternatives are so bereft of nutrients that they have to be supplemented with added vitamins and minerals to appear even slightly beneficial. Only soy milk has a meaningful amount of protein. But soy milk comes with its own problems, like a hefty amount of phytoestrogens, which may mimic estrogen in the body when consumed in excess. Even worse, many varieties of soy milk are made soy protein isolates linked to cancer rather than whole beans. A little soy may be fine, but choose organic, non-GMO to avoid glyphosate which has been linked to cancer.\r\n\r\n**When it comes to choosing between the different milk substitutes, what type would you recommend we try out?**\r\n\r\nI usually recommend making your own milk substitutes. It’s easy — just soak a bag of almonds, hazelnuts, or cashews in a bowl overnight to soften them up, and then blend them with water and a little vanilla extract. Soaking them also unlocks their nutrients, which makes them easier for your body to absorb. But make small batches; the milk doesn’t keep for long (more than a week in the fridge).

18	Everything You Need to Know About Milk Substitutes	Oat milk. Almond milk. Cashew milk. Soy milk. There are so many milk alternatives out there today… and it can be tough to figure out what types might be best for you. Enter our favorite healthy eating expert Dr. Mark Hyman, author of Food: What the Heck Should I Cook?. He’s here to help us understand why these milk alternatives have become so popular in recent years — and which types might be the most beneficial.\r\n\r\n**Katie Couric: It used to be that, at a coffee shop, you had a choice between milk or cream. Now? It’s all that — and so much more. Before we go into the various types of milk substitutes and their benefits (or lack thereof), can you tell us a bit about the rise in alternatives to milk? What spurred this trend?**\r\n\r\nDr. Mark Hyman: Milk alternatives are everywhere. An important reason behind this trend is the growing awareness that many people don’t digest dairy well. Sixty to 70 percent of the world’s population is lactose intolerant. This is a deficiency of the enzyme required to break down the sugar (lactose) in cow’s milk. Consumers are more conscious about the way food impacts how they feel.\r\n\r\nIn my practice, dairy affects my patients in many ways related to inflammation: gastrointestinal issues such as irritable bowel or reflux, asthma and sinus problems, eczema and acne. People understand that dairy alternatives can provide the culinary benefits without the risks. There is also increasing concern about factory farming of animals, and its impact on animal welfare, the overuse of antibiotics and hormones, climate change and environmental degradation. These are among the main reasons we see a rise in milk alternatives.\r\n\r\n**Now, can you tell us about the different types of milk substitutes?**\r\n\r\nSoy milk was the first dairy alternative, but competitors have flourished in the wake of concerns about soy, glyphosate (the herbicide used on soybeans and its potential estrogenic effects. Today almond, coconut, cashew, hazelnut, hemp, macadamia and oat milk are found in most stores. In the past decade we’ve seen a renaissance non-dairy milks. Large food companies are buying up the small milk alternative companies following the trend away from traditional dairy.\r\n\r\n**Are milk substitutes actually healthy? Are they any better or worse for us than regular milk? What should we watch out for with these dairy alternatives?**\r\n\r\nJust because it’s natural or from beans or nuts doesn’t mean it’s healthy. Most versions of non-dairy milks are loaded with sugar, gums and thickeners. Even the organic, unsweetened versions contain additives designed to make nut and rice water look and taste like cow’s milk.\r\n\r\nOne of these additives is carrageenan, a thickening agent that’s used in ice cream, yogurt, cottage cheese, and other dairy products. It’s derived from seaweed, but it’s no innocent sea vegetable. It’s an irritant that causes cancer in lab rats. In humans, carrageenan has been associated with ulcers, leaky gut, inflammation and even autoimmune disease. It has no nutritional value, and yet the FDA approves its use in baby formula. It should be avoided completely. Other thickeners may not be as problematic but are still cause for concerns such as the gums — xanthan gum, guar gum, locust bean gum — and anything else that sounds like it was made in a lab.\r\n\r\nYou’re not losing much by skipping these mass-produced drinks. In fact, many milk alternatives are so bereft of nutrients that they have to be supplemented with added vitamins and minerals to appear even slightly beneficial. Only soy milk has a meaningful amount of protein. But soy milk comes with its own problems, like a hefty amount of phytoestrogens, which may mimic estrogen in the body when consumed in excess. Even worse, many varieties of soy milk are made soy protein isolates linked to cancer rather than whole beans. A little soy may be fine, but choose organic, non-GMO to avoid glyphosate which has been linked to cancer.\r\n\r\n**When it comes to choosing between the different milk substitutes, what type would you recommend we try out?**\r\n\r\nI usually recommend making your own milk substitutes.

Soaking them also unlocks their nutrients, which makes them easier for your body to absorb. But make small batches; the milk doesn’t keep for long (more than a week in the fridge). You can also make your own coconut milk.\r\n\r\nIf this isn’t possible, there are a few brands of non-dairy milks that are pretty clean. You just have to look at the ingredients. Stick with hemp, almond, macadamia or cashew milks but always choose unsweetened and make sure they have no carageenan.\r\n\r\n**Finally, what is your preferred milk alternative, and why?**\r\n\r\nOne of my personal favorites is macadamia milk. It’s really creamy and tasty. Macadamia nuts contain beneficial monounsaturated fats that support metabolic and cardiovascular health and nutrients that support brain health, so overall they make a very nutrient-dense milk substitute.\r\n	2019-12-20 04:49:48.135012	2019-12-20 04:49:48.135012	everything-you-need-to-know-about-milk-substitutes-7f292be9-4291-4faf-bec9-9fbed7589725	1	1	\N
29	Everything You Need to Know About Milk Substitutes	Oat milk. Almond milk. Cashew milk. Soy milk. There are so many milk alternatives out there today… and it can be tough to figure out what types might be best for you. Enter our favorite healthy eating expert Dr. Mark Hyman, author of Food: What the Heck Should I Cook?. He’s here to help us understand why these milk alternatives have become so popular in recent years — and which types might be the most beneficial.\r\n\r\n**Katie Couric: It used to be that, at a coffee shop, you had a choice between milk or cream. Now? It’s all that — and so much more. Before we go into the various types of milk substitutes and their benefits (or lack thereof), can you tell us a bit about the rise in alternatives to milk? What spurred this trend?**\r\n\r\nDr. Mark Hyman: Milk alternatives are everywhere. An important reason behind this trend is the growing awareness that many people don’t digest dairy well. Sixty to 70 percent of the world’s population is lactose intolerant. This is a deficiency of the enzyme required to break down the sugar (lactose) in cow’s milk. Consumers are more conscious about the way food impacts how they feel.\r\n\r\nIn my practice, dairy affects my patients in many ways related to inflammation: gastrointestinal issues such as irritable bowel or reflux, asthma and sinus problems, eczema and acne. People understand that dairy alternatives can provide the culinary benefits without the risks. There is also increasing concern about factory farming of animals, and its impact on animal welfare, the overuse of antibiotics and hormones, climate change and environmental degradation. These are among the main reasons we see a rise in milk alternatives.\r\n\r\n**Now, can you tell us about the different types of milk substitutes?**\r\n\r\nSoy milk was the first dairy alternative, but competitors have flourished in the wake of concerns about soy, glyphosate (the herbicide used on soybeans and its potential estrogenic effects. Today almond, coconut, cashew, hazelnut, hemp, macadamia and oat milk are found in most stores. In the past decade we’ve seen a renaissance non-dairy milks. Large food companies are buying up the small milk alternative companies following the trend away from traditional dairy.\r\n\r\n**Are milk substitutes actually healthy? Are they any better or worse for us than regular milk? What should we watch out for with these dairy alternatives?**\r\n\r\nJust because it’s natural or from beans or nuts doesn’t mean it’s healthy. Most versions of non-dairy milks are loaded with sugar, gums and thickeners. Even the organic, unsweetened versions contain additives designed to make nut and rice water look and taste like cow’s milk.\r\n\r\nOne of these additives is carrageenan, a thickening agent that’s used in ice cream, yogurt, cottage cheese, and other dairy products. It’s derived from seaweed, but it’s no innocent sea vegetable. It’s an irritant that causes cancer in lab rats. In humans, carrageenan has been associated with ulcers, leaky gut, inflammation and even autoimmune disease. It has no nutritional value, and yet the FDA approves its use in baby formula. It should be avoided completely. Other thickeners may not be as problematic but are still cause for concerns such as the gums — xanthan gum, guar gum, locust bean gum — and anything else that sounds like it was made in a lab.\r\n\r\nYou’re not losing much by skipping these mass-produced drinks. In fact, many milk alternatives are so bereft of nutrients that they have to be supplemented with added vitamins and minerals to appear even slightly beneficial. Only soy milk has a meaningful amount of protein. But soy milk comes with its own problems, like a hefty amount of phytoestrogens, which may mimic estrogen in the body when consumed in excess. Even worse, many varieties of soy milk are made soy protein isolates linked to cancer rather than whole beans. A little soy may be fine, but choose organic, non-GMO to avoid glyphosate which has been linked to cancer.\r\n\r\n**When it comes to choosing between the different milk substitutes, what type would you recommend we try out?**\r\n\r\nI usually recommend making your own milk substitutes.

A little soy may be fine, but choose organic, non-GMO to avoid glyphosate which has been linked to cancer.\r\n\r\n**When it comes to choosing between the different milk substitutes, what type would you recommend we try out?**\r\n\r\nI usually recommend making your own milk substitutes. It’s easy — just soak a bag of almonds, hazelnuts, or cashews in a bowl overnight to soften them up, and then blend them with water and a little vanilla extract. Soaking them also unlocks their nutrients, which makes them easier for your body to absorb. But make small batches; the milk doesn’t keep for long (more than a week in the fridge). You can also make your own coconut milk.\r\n\r\nIf this isn’t possible, there are a few brands of non-dairy milks that are pretty clean. You just have to look at the ingredients. Stick with hemp, almond, macadamia or cashew milks but always choose unsweetened and make sure they have no carageenan.\r\n\r\n**Finally, what is your preferred milk alternative, and why?**\r\n\r\nOne of my personal favorites is macadamia milk. It’s really creamy and tasty. Macadamia nuts contain beneficial monounsaturated fats that support metabolic and cardiovascular health and nutrients that support brain health, so overall they make a very nutrient-dense milk substitute.\r\n	2019-12-20 04:49:48.174591	2019-12-20 04:49:48.174591	everything-you-need-to-know-about-milk-substitutes-1d001dc1-e33d-4a4e-97a8-66ea3ae93c46	1	1	\N
35	Everything You Need to Know About Milk Substitutes	Oat milk. Almond milk. Cashew milk. Soy milk. There are so many milk alternatives out there today… and it can be tough to figure out what types might be best for you. Enter our favorite healthy eating expert Dr. Mark Hyman, author of Food: What the Heck Should I Cook?. He’s here to help us understand why these milk alternatives have become so popular in recent years — and which types might be the most beneficial.\r\n\r\n**Katie Couric: It used to be that, at a coffee shop, you had a choice between milk or cream. Now? It’s all that — and so much more. Before we go into the various types of milk substitutes and their benefits (or lack thereof), can you tell us a bit about the rise in alternatives to milk? What spurred this trend?**\r\n\r\nDr. Mark Hyman: Milk alternatives are everywhere. An important reason behind this trend is the growing awareness that many people don’t digest dairy well. Sixty to 70 percent of the world’s population is lactose intolerant. This is a deficiency of the enzyme required to break down the sugar (lactose) in cow’s milk. Consumers are more conscious about the way food impacts how they feel.\r\n\r\nIn my practice, dairy affects my patients in many ways related to inflammation: gastrointestinal issues such as irritable bowel or reflux, asthma and sinus problems, eczema and acne. People understand that dairy alternatives can provide the culinary benefits without the risks. There is also increasing concern about factory farming of animals, and its impact on animal welfare, the overuse of antibiotics and hormones, climate change and environmental degradation. These are among the main reasons we see a rise in milk alternatives.\r\n\r\n**Now, can you tell us about the different types of milk substitutes?**\r\n\r\nSoy milk was the first dairy alternative, but competitors have flourished in the wake of concerns about soy, glyphosate (the herbicide used on soybeans and its potential estrogenic effects. Today almond, coconut, cashew, hazelnut, hemp, macadamia and oat milk are found in most stores. In the past decade we’ve seen a renaissance non-dairy milks. Large food companies are buying up the small milk alternative companies following the trend away from traditional dairy.\r\n\r\n**Are milk substitutes actually healthy? Are they any better or worse for us than regular milk? What should we watch out for with these dairy alternatives?**\r\n\r\nJust because it’s natural or from beans or nuts doesn’t mean it’s healthy. Most versions of non-dairy milks are loaded with sugar, gums and thickeners. Even the organic, unsweetened versions contain additives designed to make nut and rice water look and taste like cow’s milk.\r\n\r\nOne of these additives is carrageenan, a thickening agent that’s used in ice cream, yogurt, cottage cheese, and other dairy products. It’s derived from seaweed, but it’s no innocent sea vegetable. It’s an irritant that causes cancer in lab rats. In humans, carrageenan has been associated with ulcers, leaky gut, inflammation and even autoimmune disease. It has no nutritional value, and yet the FDA approves its use in baby formula. It should be avoided completely. Other thickeners may not be as problematic but are still cause for concerns such as the gums — xanthan gum, guar gum, locust bean gum — and anything else that sounds like it was made in a lab.\r\n\r\nYou’re not losing much by skipping these mass-produced drinks. In fact, many milk alternatives are so bereft of nutrients that they have to be supplemented with added vitamins and minerals to appear even slightly beneficial. Only soy milk has a meaningful amount of protein. But soy milk comes with its own problems, like a hefty amount of phytoestrogens, which may mimic estrogen in the body when consumed in excess.

Even worse, many varieties of soy milk are made soy protein isolates linked to cancer rather than whole beans. A little soy may be fine, but choose organic, non-GMO to avoid glyphosate which has been linked to cancer.\r\n\r\n**When it comes to choosing between the different milk substitutes, what type would you recommend we try out?**\r\n\r\nI usually recommend making your own milk substitutes. It’s easy — just soak a bag of almonds, hazelnuts, or cashews in a bowl overnight to soften them up, and then blend them with water and a little vanilla extract. Soaking them also unlocks their nutrients, which makes them easier for your body to absorb. But make small batches; the milk doesn’t keep for long (more than a week in the fridge). You can also make your own coconut milk.\r\n\r\nIf this isn’t possible, there are a few brands of non-dairy milks that are pretty clean. You just have to look at the ingredients. Stick with hemp, almond, macadamia or cashew milks but always choose unsweetened and make sure they have no carageenan.\r\n\r\n**Finally, what is your preferred milk alternative, and why?**\r\n\r\nOne of my personal favorites is macadamia milk. It’s really creamy and tasty. Macadamia nuts contain beneficial monounsaturated fats that support metabolic and cardiovascular health and nutrients that support brain health, so overall they make a very nutrient-dense milk substitute.\r\n	2019-12-20 04:49:48.213935	2019-12-20 04:49:48.213935	everything-you-need-to-know-about-milk-substitutes-8b13e3be-6240-4165-a200-94ea6a11b33f	1	1	\N
41	Everything You Need to Know About Milk Substitutes	Oat milk. Almond milk. Cashew milk. Soy milk. There are so many milk alternatives out there today… and it can be tough to figure out what types might be best for you. Enter our favorite healthy eating expert Dr. Mark Hyman, author of Food: What the Heck Should I Cook?. He’s here to help us understand why these milk alternatives have become so popular in recent years — and which types might be the most beneficial.\r\n\r\n**Katie Couric: It used to be that, at a coffee shop, you had a choice between milk or cream. Now? It’s all that — and so much more. Before we go into the various types of milk substitutes and their benefits (or lack thereof), can you tell us a bit about the rise in alternatives to milk? What spurred this trend?**\r\n\r\nDr. Mark Hyman: Milk alternatives are everywhere. An important reason behind this trend is the growing awareness that many people don’t digest dairy well. Sixty to 70 percent of the world’s population is lactose intolerant. This is a deficiency of the enzyme required to break down the sugar (lactose) in cow’s milk. Consumers are more conscious about the way food impacts how they feel.\r\n\r\nIn my practice, dairy affects my patients in many ways related to inflammation: gastrointestinal issues such as irritable bowel or reflux, asthma and sinus problems, eczema and acne. People understand that dairy alternatives can provide the culinary benefits without the risks. There is also increasing concern about factory farming of animals, and its impact on animal welfare, the overuse of antibiotics and hormones, climate change and environmental degradation. These are among the main reasons we see a rise in milk alternatives.\r\n\r\n**Now, can you tell us about the different types of milk substitutes?**\r\n\r\nSoy milk was the first dairy alternative, but competitors have flourished in the wake of concerns about soy, glyphosate (the herbicide used on soybeans and its potential estrogenic effects. Today almond, coconut, cashew, hazelnut, hemp, macadamia and oat milk are found in most stores. In the past decade we’ve seen a renaissance non-dairy milks. Large food companies are buying up the small milk alternative companies following the trend away from traditional dairy.\r\n\r\n**Are milk substitutes actually healthy? Are they any better or worse for us than regular milk? What should we watch out for with these dairy alternatives?**\r\n\r\nJust because it’s natural or from beans or nuts doesn’t mean it’s healthy. Most versions of non-dairy milks are loaded with sugar, gums and thickeners. Even the organic, unsweetened versions contain additives designed to make nut and rice water look and taste like cow’s milk.\r\n\r\nOne of these additives is carrageenan, a thickening agent that’s used in ice cream, yogurt, cottage cheese, and other dairy products. It’s derived from seaweed, but it’s no innocent sea vegetable. It’s an irritant that causes cancer in lab rats. In humans, carrageenan has been associated with ulcers, leaky gut, inflammation and even autoimmune disease. It has no nutritional value, and yet the FDA approves its use in baby formula. It should be avoided completely. Other thickeners may not be as problematic but are still cause for concerns such as the gums — xanthan gum, guar gum, locust bean gum — and anything else that sounds like it was made in a lab.\r\n\r\nYou’re not losing much by skipping these mass-produced drinks.

Only soy milk has a meaningful amount of protein. But soy milk comes with its own problems, like a hefty amount of phytoestrogens, which may mimic estrogen in the body when consumed in excess. Even worse, many varieties of soy milk are made soy protein isolates linked to cancer rather than whole beans. A little soy may be fine, but choose organic, non-GMO to avoid glyphosate which has been linked to cancer.\r\n\r\n**When it comes to choosing between the different milk substitutes, what type would you recommend we try out?**\r\n\r\nI usually recommend making your own milk substitutes. It’s easy — just soak a bag of almonds, hazelnuts, or cashews in a bowl overnight to soften them up, and then blend them with water and a little vanilla extract. Soaking them also unlocks their nutrients, which makes them easier for your body to absorb. But make small batches; the milk doesn’t keep for long (more than a week in the fridge). You can also make your own coconut milk.\r\n\r\nIf this isn’t possible, there are a few brands of non-dairy milks that are pretty clean. You just have to look at the ingredients. Stick with hemp, almond, macadamia or cashew milks but always choose unsweetened and make sure they have no carageenan.\r\n\r\n**Finally, what is your preferred milk alternative, and why?**\r\n\r\nOne of my personal favorites is macadamia milk. It’s really creamy and tasty. Macadamia nuts contain beneficial monounsaturated fats that support metabolic and cardiovascular health and nutrients that support brain health, so overall they make a very nutrient-dense milk substitute.\r\n	2019-12-20 04:49:48.233753	2019-12-20 04:49:48.233753	everything-you-need-to-know-about-milk-substitutes-837a687e-b0f9-4fa7-bf50-409a17eb7b59	1	1	\N
47	Everything You Need to Know About Milk Substitutes	Oat milk. Almond milk. Cashew milk. Soy milk. There are so many milk alternatives out there today… and it can be tough to figure out what types might be best for you. Enter our favorite healthy eating expert Dr. Mark Hyman, author of Food: What the Heck Should I Cook?. He’s here to help us understand why these milk alternatives have become so popular in recent years — and which types might be the most beneficial.\r\n\r\n**Katie Couric: It used to be that, at a coffee shop, you had a choice between milk or cream. Now? It’s all that — and so much more. Before we go into the various types of milk substitutes and their benefits (or lack thereof), can you tell us a bit about the rise in alternatives to milk? What spurred this trend?**\r\n\r\nDr. Mark Hyman: Milk alternatives are everywhere. An important reason behind this trend is the growing awareness that many people don’t digest dairy well. Sixty to 70 percent of the world’s population is lactose intolerant. This is a deficiency of the enzyme required to break down the sugar (lactose) in cow’s milk. Consumers are more conscious about the way food impacts how they feel.\r\n\r\nIn my practice, dairy affects my patients in many ways related to inflammation: gastrointestinal issues such as irritable bowel or reflux, asthma and sinus problems, eczema and acne. People understand that dairy alternatives can provide the culinary benefits without the risks. There is also increasing concern about factory farming of animals, and its impact on animal welfare, the overuse of antibiotics and hormones, climate change and environmental degradation. These are among the main reasons we see a rise in milk alternatives.\r\n\r\n**Now, can you tell us about the different types of milk substitutes?**\r\n\r\nSoy milk was the first dairy alternative, but competitors have flourished in the wake of concerns about soy, glyphosate (the herbicide used on soybeans and its potential estrogenic effects. Today almond, coconut, cashew, hazelnut, hemp, macadamia and oat milk are found in most stores. In the past decade we’ve seen a renaissance non-dairy milks. Large food companies are buying up the small milk alternative companies following the trend away from traditional dairy.\r\n\r\n**Are milk substitutes actually healthy? Are they any better or worse for us than regular milk? What should we watch out for with these dairy alternatives?**\r\n\r\nJust because it’s natural or from beans or nuts doesn’t mean it’s healthy. Most versions of non-dairy milks are loaded with sugar, gums and thickeners. Even the organic, unsweetened versions contain additives designed to make nut and rice water look and taste like cow’s milk.\r\n\r\nOne of these additives is carrageenan, a thickening agent that’s used in ice cream, yogurt, cottage cheese, and other dairy products. It’s derived from seaweed, but it’s no innocent sea vegetable. It’s an irritant that causes cancer in lab rats. In humans, carrageenan has been associated with ulcers, leaky gut, inflammation and even autoimmune disease. It has no nutritional value, and yet the FDA approves its use in baby formula. It should be avoided completely. Other thickeners may not be as problematic but are still cause for concerns such as the gums — xanthan gum, guar gum, locust bean gum — and anything else that sounds like it was made in a lab.\r\n\r\nYou’re not losing much by skipping these mass-produced drinks.

Do đó bạn nên commit Gemfile.lock vào git và keep up to date để những máy khác, bao gồm production server sử dụng đúng gem và dependencies như ở môi trường local.\r\n\r\nKhi deploy lên server, recommend theo bundler là sử dụng flag **```--  deployment```**, điều này sẽ mang lại các tính năng:\r\n\t- Bundler sẽ cài đặt gem vào thư mục   **```vendor/bundle```** bên trong folder app. Nó sẽ ghi nhớ location này bên trong application (với  **```Bundler.setup```** và  **```Bundler.require```**)\r\n\t- Bundler không sử dụng gem có sẵn trên server, ngay cả khi nó tồn tại.\r\n\t- Nếu bạn chạy **```bundle pack```** và lưu vào trong folder **```vendor/cache```**, bundler sẽ sử dụng nó mà không fetch từ remote source khi cài đặt\r\n\t- Bundler luôn yêu cầu file Gemfile.lock và sẽ return fail nếu không có\r\n\t- Bundler tự động update Gemfile.lock nếu nó out of date với Gemfile\r\n\t\r\n##Bundle update\r\nLệnh dùng để cài đặt gem chỉ định ( tất cả gem nếu không chỉ định ), bỏ qua các gems đã cài đặt trong Gemfile.lock. \r\n\t- Nếu gem không được define version trong Gemfile thì sẽ cài đặt version mới nhất\r\n\t- Nếu gem được define version, sẽ cài đặt version với patch lớn nhất ( final digit )\r\n\r\n> Để đảm bảo sử dụng đúng các version gem mong muốn, luôn thêm version của gem vào Gemfile và luôn sử dụng bundle install. Chỉ sử dụng bundle update khi thật sự cần thiết và đã test version gem mới hoạt động tốt.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Kết\r\nTrên đây là vài lưu ý mà mình cảm thấy cần thiết khi mới làm quen với bundle & rails. Các bạn có thể đọc đầy đủ ở http://bundler.io. Lần đầu mình viết blog nên bài viết còn hơi sơ sài, mình sẽ cố gắng cải thiện :D. Chúc bạn tìm được những thứ hữu ích ở blog của mình.

81	Thử debug và customize gem friendly_id Rails	## Tình huống\r\n\r\nFriendly_id là 1 gem được sử dụng để tạo friendly url. Nó mô tả ngắn gọn cho user về trang mà chúng ta sẽ chuyển đến, ngoài ra URL chứa từ khóa sẽ làm tăng giá trị của bài viết vì trong SEO, đường dẫn URL tốt sẽ giúp cho Google index dễ dàng hơn. Các bạn có thể xem qua cài đặt ở đây [github](https://github.com/norman/friendly_id). \r\n\r\nKhi mình sử dụng thì với các title tiếng Việt như:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n"Bundle & Những thứ cần biết"\r\n```\r\n\r\nnó sẽ trở thành\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n"bundler-nh-ng-th-c-n-bi-t"\r\n```\r\n\r\nMình sẽ đi debug gem này để xem lỗi nằm ở đâu.\r\n\r\n## Bắt đầu\r\n\r\nCác bạn có thể tìm thấy đường dẫn source code của gem bằng cách gõ \r\n\t\r\n```ruby\r\nbundle show friendly\r\n```\r\n\r\nsau đó mở folder bằng IDE. Mình dùng RubyMine nên chỉ cần click vào tên module **```FriendlyId```** là nó sẽ nhảy đến folder source. \r\n\r\n![](https://2.pik.vn/2019c795a5cc-b254-4c4d-8ce4-63c1c2aaef7f.png)\r\n\r\nTrong module FriendlyId có load khá nhiều module nhỏ, mình để ý là friendly url được lưu với column **```slug```** nên sẽ tìm có module có liên quan đến set slug. Ở đây bạn có thể đặt byebug để tìm xem nó sẽ chạy vào method nào. \r\n\r\nSau một hồi mò mẫm thì mình cũng phát hiện ra FriendlyId sử dụng Rails's **```parameterize```** method để generate slug. \r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# lib/friendly_id/slugged.rb\r\ndef normalize_friendly_id(value)\r\n\tvalue.to_s.parameterize\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nTrong method này sử dụng method **```transliterate```** để replace những kí tự non-ASCII trở thành kí tự ASCII tương đương.\r\n\r\n\r\nTheo [doc](https://apidock.com/rails/v5.2.3/ActiveSupport/Inflector/transliterate), mình tạo file **```config/locales/vi.yml```** và thêm các kí tự tiếng Việt. Gem rails-i18n đã có define sẵn nên mình copy luôn [github](https://github.com/svenfuchs/rails-i18n/blob/master/rails/transliteration/vi.yml).  Sau đó mình cần phải set **```I18n.locale```** thành **```:vi```**. Tuy nhiên mình không muốn thay đổi locale của toàn bộ app, nên mình sẽ customize lại method **```normalize_friendly_id```**.\r\n\r\nMình tạo file **```friendly_id_slugged.rb```** trong folder **```config/initializers```**. Vì method nằm trong module Slugged < FriendlyId nên mình define như sau:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nmodule FriendlyId\r\n  module Slugged\r\n    def normalize_friendly_id(value)\r\n      I18n.transliterate(value.to_s, locale: :vi).parameterize\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nVào rails console để kiểm tra:\r\n\r\n![](https://2.pik.vn/20198c5cfd9e-fe5a-4b80-ad4f-45d81fd5cbe5.png)\r\n\r\nKết quả\r\n\r\n![](https://2.pik.vn/2019c07b30ac-b8bb-427a-b5e6-58840b198746.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n	2019-12-25 07:34:58.400234	2019-12-26 01:28:50.130408	th-debug-va-customize-gem-rails	1	3	Trường hợp của mình là muốn sử dụng gem friendly tạo url từ title tiếng Việt
